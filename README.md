# Smart Contract App

A simple Ethereum-based web application that allows users to interact with a smart contract. Users can fund the contract, check the balance, and withdraw funds. This app is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, utilizing MetaMask for wallet integration and Web3 or Ethers.js for Ethereum interactions.

## Features

- **Connect to MetaMask:** Users can connect their MetaMask wallet to interact with the app.
- **Fund Contract:** Users can fund the contract by specifying an amount of ETH.
- **Check Balance:** Users can check the balance of the smart contract.
- **Withdraw Funds:** Authorized users can withdraw funds from the contract.

## Prerequisites

Before using this app, make sure you have:

- **Node.js** and **npm** installed.
- **MetaMask** extension installed in your browser.
- **Ethereum Test Network** setup in MetaMask (e.g., Goerli, Sepolia).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/oluibk2020/smartcontract_frontendHTMLCSS
   cd html-fund-me-cu
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   If your project requires additional libraries (like Web3.js or Ethers.js), install them via npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up the Smart Contract**

   Deploy the smart contract to your preferred Ethereum network (e.g., Goerli, Sepolia) and take note of the contract address.

4. **Update Contract Details**

   Open `constant.js` and add your contract address and ABI where necessary.

5. **Launch the App**

   Open `index.html` in your browser to interact with the app. Make sure MetaMask is connected to the network where your smart contract is deployed.

## Usage

- **Connect Wallet:** Click the “Connect to MetaMask” button. After connecting, your wallet address should appear on the screen.
- **Fund the Contract:** Enter the amount in ETH and click “Fund.” Ensure you have enough ETH in your connected wallet.
- **Check Balance:** Click the “Check Balance” button to display the contract’s balance.
- **Withdraw Funds:** Click “Withdraw” to trigger the withdrawal function on the smart contract. Make sure only authorized accounts can withdraw.

## Project Structure

- **index.html** - Main HTML file with the app’s structure.
- **style.css** - Contains styling for the app layout and design.
- **app.js** - JavaScript logic for MetaMask integration and smart contract interaction.

## Built With

- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**
- **MetaMask** for Ethereum wallet integration
- **Web3.js** or **Ethers.js** for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain

## Notes

- This app currently only supports funding in ETH.
- Ensure you are connected to the correct Ethereum network (Testnet or Mainnet).
- Only certain accounts should be allowed to withdraw funds. Modify the smart contract accordingly.
